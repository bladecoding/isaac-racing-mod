# Racing+ Diversity Races

## General Description

In diversity races, each racer starts with the same 3 random passive items. (This is in addition to the character's original passive items and resources.) These items are hidden from the player until the race starts.

In general, the extra power level increase from these 3 items is a fun boost at the beginning of a run. However, you don't always start with "good" items! One of the most interesting things about diversity races is that it forces players to use the items in the game that they would not normally pick up. This puts players in unique situations (with regards to item synergies) that they would never otherwise be in. For example, in a normal speedrun or race, you would generally never want to touch Libra. But on a diversity race that happens to start with Soy Milk, picking up Libra is a very good idea!

Diversity is meant to be a fun mode, and there is no official leaderboard for it. Thus, you can only play it in the "Unranked" mode.

## Reset Time Reduction

To cut down on the reset time to get the run going, the first Treasure Room will always have 2 item pedestals.

## Item Bans

The following items are removed from all items pools, because they override tear effects. Note that it is still possible to start with them as one of the 3 random passive items.

* Mom's Knife
* Epic Fetus
* Tech X

The following items are also removed from all item pools, because they allow you to re-roll your build, which spoils the fun.

* D4
* D100
* D Infinity

## Extra Included Items

To add to the diversity, several extra starting items are added to the Treasure Room Pool, but ONLY for Basement 1:

* Crown of Light
* Godhead
* Sacred Heart
* Incubus
