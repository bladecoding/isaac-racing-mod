Known Bugs
----------

Some bugs are unfixable due to the limitations of the Afterbirth+ Lua API.

* Fast-clear does not apply to Challenge Rooms or the Boss Rush.
* If you return from a crawlspace, your character will touch anything in the center of the room, as demonstrated in [this video](https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyBumblingShieldTwitchRPG).
