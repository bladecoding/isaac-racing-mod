# Racing+ Mod Room Changes

## Room Changes - Balance

Firstly, some rooms were purely changed for balance (racing) reasons. Rooms with bug fixes are below in a different section.

<br />

### Devil Room Buff

* No-item Devil Rooms have been changed to have 1 item.
* Devil Rooms without 4 exits have been changed to have 4 exits.
* Devil Rooms without weight of 1.0 have been changed to have weight 1.0.
* Mom's Hand is removed from Devil Room #13.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #16 (3 Devil Beggar)
* #17 (4 items)
* #18 (5 red chests)
* #5 (3 red chests)
* #10 (2 items and 1 Devil Beggar)
* #11 (2 items and 2 Nulls)
* #13 (1 item and 1 Mom's Hand)
* #14 (2 black hearts and 1 Imp)
* #15 (1 item, vertical narrow room)

<br />

### Angel Room Buff

* Angel Rooms without at least 1 item have been deleted.
* Angel Rooms without 4 exits have been changed to have 4 exits.
* Angel Rooms without weight of 1.0 have been changed to have weight 1.0.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #14 (2 items)
* #6 (1 item, 4 purple fires)

The removed rooms are as follows:
* #15 (2 soul hearts)
* #13 (5 soul hearts)
* #3 (3 soul hearts)
* #4 (2 eternal hearts)
* #7 (1 eternal heart and 4 soul hearts)
* #9 (1 item, vertical narrow room)

<br />

### Treasure Room Fix

The Treasure Room with two pedestals and spikes has been slightly tweaked so that some characters can use a bomb to get the item without spending a soul heart.

The changed room is as follows:
* Treasure Room: #21

<br />

### Trapdoor Room

On Sheol, there exists a room with a trapdoor that takes you directly to the Dark Room without having to fight Satan. This puts too much of an extreme lower bound on the clear time of the floor.

The removed room is as follows:
* Sheol: #290

<br />





## Room Changes - Bug Fixes

The Racing+ mod tries to fix as many bugs as possible. Unavoidable damage is classified as a bug, but difficult rooms are not.

<br />

### Boss Room Door Fix (Part 1)

It is not possible for Devil Room doors to spawn on boss rooms that only have one entrance. For this reason, several rooms were adjusted to allow for at least two entrances.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #2065 (Fistula)
* #5026 (Dingle)
* #5044 (The Gate)
* #5145 (Gurglings)

<br />

### Boss Room Door Fix (Part 2)

If you have Duality and there is only 2 entrances to a boss room, the Angel Room will not spawn. For this reason, all non-narrow rooms were adjusted to allow for a third door where possible.

* #1025, #1027, #1028, #1048, #1049 (Larry Jr.)
* #1045 (Monstro)
* #1057 (Chub)
* #1089, #1095 (Little Horn)
* #1099 (Dingle 2)
* #2064 (Fistula)
* #3264, #3265, #3266 (The Hollow)
* #3701, #3713, #3714, #3716, #3756, #3760, #3762, #3765, #3766, #3767, #3769, #3807, #3811 (Double Trouble)
* #4012 (Famine)
* #4033 (Conquest)
* #5033 (Mega Maw)
* #5083 (Dark One)
* #5106 (Polycephalus)

<br />

### Unfair Narrow Room Adjustement

While not technically unavoidable, many narrow rooms have near-impossible attack patterns, especially on Dr. Fetus builds.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Basement #755 (Rag Man) (replaced a pot with a red fire)
* Cathedral: #286 (Uriel) (changed to 1x1)
* Cathedral: #291 (Gabriel) (changed to 1x1)
* Chest: #262 (Headless Horseman Head x2) (changed to 1x1)
* Chest: #269 (Mega Maw) (changed to 1x1)
* Chest: #264 (Monstro x2) (changed to 1x1)
* Chest: #273 (Monstro x2) (deleted)
* Chest: #275 (The Fallen) (changed to 1x1)
* Chest: #283 (Gurdy Jr.) (deleted)
* Chest: #309 (Monstro x4) (deleted)
* Dark Room: #255, #274 (Teratoma) (deleted)
* Dark Room: #256, #275 (The Fallen) (deleted)
* Dark Room: #263 (The Forsaken) (deleted)
* Dark Room: #270 (4 Nulls) (deleted)
* Dark Room: #312 (5 Nulls) (deleted)
* Boss: #2305 (Krampus) (deleted)
* Boss: #2306 (Krampus) (deleted)
* Boss: #4036 (War) (deleted)
* Boss: #5035 (Mega Maw) (deleted)
* Boss: #5043 (The Gate) (deleted)
* Miniboss: #2065 (Pride) (removed TNT barrels)
* Angel Room: #9 (deleted)

<br />

### Dople & Evil Twin Fix

When shooting in a forward direction and entering a room with a Dople or Evil Twin, the player can be with an unavoidable tear. Rarely, this can also occur even if the player is not shooting. This bug is fixed by changing all the spawn points of the enemies to be near the corner of the room. Once the room is loaded, the enemy will snap back to where they are supposed to be, but the initial buggy tear will not be in line with the player.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Womb: #56-#62, #114-#118, #259-#261, #289, #301, #598, #605, #624, #646, #661
* Utero: #56-#62, #114-#117, #259-#261, #289, #301, #598, #605, #624, #646, #661
* Sheol: #19-#24, #42, #56-#57, #61, #166, #181, #188, #196
* Dark Room: #272

<br />

### Double Boss Champion Fix

Some rooms have Monstros, Gurdy Jr.'s, Cages, or Sisters Vis that spawn near an entrance. If the double champion version spawns and they happen to spawn in a diagonal orientation, the player will be touched while the room is loading and automatically take damage. This bug is fixed by moving the enemies closer to the center of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Utero: #133 (Gurdy Jr.)
* Sheol: #212 (Cage)
* Chest: #14, #56 (Gurdy Jr.)
* Chest: #34 (Cage)
* Chest: #43, #69 (Monstro)
* Chest: #94 (Sisters Vis)
* Chest: #301 (Gurglings)
* The Dark Room: #14, #83 (Cage)
* The Dark Room: #34 (Monstro)

<br />

### Exploding Enemies Fix

Some rooms have exploding enemies that spawn near an entrance. If the player has a sufficient number of unused blue flies, the flies will kill the enemy while the room is loading and the player will automatically take damage. This bug is fixed by moving the enemy closer to the center of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Basement: #129, #130, #393, #359 (Mulligan)
* Cellar: #129, #130 (Mulligoon)
* Cellar: #359 (Mulligan)
* Caves: #46, #50, #440, #518 (Boom Fly)
* Caves: #141 (Clotty)
* Caves: #255 (Maggot)
* Caves: #553 (Hive)
* Caves: #548 (Drowned Hive)
* Catacombs: #46, #440, #518 (Boom Fly)
* Catacombs: #548 (Drowned Hive)
* Depths: #11 (Boom Fly)
* Depths: #16 (Brain)
* Womb: #203 (Lump)
* Womb: #333 (Fistula)
* Womb: #410 (Sucker)
* Utero: #203 (Lump)
* Utero #333 (Fistula)
* Utero #410 (Sucker)
* Cathedral: #30 (Kamikaze Leech)
* Cathedral: #272 (Floating Knight)
* Sheol: #30 (Kamikaze Leech)
* Chest: #53, #72, #84 (Fistula)
* Dark Room: #238, #272 (Kamikaze Leech)
* Dark Room: #264 (Bone Knight)

<br />

### TNT Barrel Fix

Some rooms have TNT barrels that will immediately explode if the player is holding Mom's Knife. These rooms have been fixed by replacing the barrels in question.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Basement: #748
* Cellar: #748

<br />

### Fly Champion Fix

Certain enemies spawn near a door. If they spawn as the white fly champion variant, the player will be touched while the room is loading and automatically take damage. This bug is fixed by moving the enemies closer to the center of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Cellar: #236 (Sack)
* Womb: #182, #471, #508, #733 (Gurglings)
* Utero: #182, #471, #733 (Gurglings)
* Chest: #35, #87, #301 (Gurglings)

<br />

### Begotten Fix 1

If a player enters from the bottom door of the 2x1 Depths / Necropolis room with the single Begotten, they will automatically take damage. It seems clear that Edmund intended for the Begotten to be attached to the block, so the room has been adjusted accordingly.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Depths: #316
* Necropolis: #316

<br />

### Begotten Fix 2

One room has Begottens that are not close enough to a well, so they immediately despawn upon entering the room, making the room completely pointless.

The deleted rooms are as follows:
* Depths: #422
* Necropolis: #422

<br />

### Clustered Gaping Maws Fix

* If a player with flying and base movement speed gets close to 4 Gaping Maws paired together, it becomes impossible to escape. This was fixed in Womb #424 by adding two Broken Gaping Maws, but the developers forgot to also make the change to Utero #424.
* In both of these rooms, there is no consistent strategy to avoid damage when entering from the bottom-left-hand door. Two pots have been placed to alleviate this.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Womb: #424
* Utero: #424

<br />

### Adversary Fix

If two Adversaries get close to a wall, the Brimstone attack can be unavoidable. This is mitigated by moving the Adversaries closer to the middle of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Chest: #41
* Dark Room: #7
* Dark Room: #50 (double Adversary, 2x1)
* Dark Room: #78 (triple Adversary, 2x2)

<br />

### Blastocyst Fix

In certain rooms with Blastocyst near a door, the player is not given enough time to reasonably dodge the first attack. The Blastocyst are slightly moved to alleviate this. On the boss room, two rocks are also placed to protect the top and bottom entrances.

The changed room is as follows:
* Boss: #2042
* Womb: #507
* Chest: #54

<br />

### Carrion Queen Fix

In some rooms, Carrion Queen spawns very close to an entrance and can automatically damage the player upon moving. This is fixed by moving her to the center of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #3270
* #3271
* #3272
* #3273

<br />

### Pin, Frail, and Scolex Fix

On Pin, Frail, and Scolex fights, there is an invisible hitbox at the spawn point shortly after they are loaded. On some rooms, this is near the entrance. This is fixed by moving the spawn to the center of the room.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #3370 (Pin)
* #3371 (Pin)
* #3372 (Pin)
* #3374 (Pin)
* #3376 (Pin)
* #3388 (Frail)
* #1070 (Scolex)
* #1071 (Scolex)
* #1073 (Scolex)
* #1074 (Scolex)

<br />

### Devil Room Maneuverability Fix

If the player is out of bombs and a Devil Room spawns in certain orientations of certain rooms, they will either not be able to access it or be forced to take the boss item in order to see the deal. This bug is fixed by moving/deleting the rocks/pits respectively.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* #2031 (Loki)
* #3311 (Lokii)
* #4041 (Death)

<br />

### Floor Exit Maneuverability Fix

In the Gurdy room filled with pits, the player is forced to take the boss item in order to exit the floor. This bug is fixed by deleting some pits to allow for more maneuverability.

The changed room is as follows:
* #1066 (Gurdy)

<br />

### Low Range Softlock Fix

Low range builds softlock in certain rooms. The rooms are fixed by moving the enemies closer.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Caves: #226, #305
* Catacombs: #305
* Depths: #226, #417
* Necropolis: #226, #417
* Womb: #458, #459
* Utero: #458, #459

<br />

### Card Room Fix

The rooms with a bugged Magician or Lovers card are fixed to be a random card.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Depths: #286 (Magician)
* Necropolis: #286 (Magician)
* Womb: #687 (Magician)
* Utero: #687 (Magician)
* Curse Room: #21 (Lovers)

<br />

### Rune Room Fix

The room with a bugged High Priestess card is fixed to be a random rune. The room with a bugged Lovers card is fixed to be a Black Rune.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Dark Room: #291 (High Priestess)
* I AM ERROR Room: #23 (Lovers)

<br />

### Narrow Red Poop Room Fix

On Dr. Fetus builds, the narrow red poop room in The Chest is unavoidable damage. This bug has been fixed by deleting some of the poops to allow for a walkable path.

The changed room is as follows:
* The Chest: #289

<br />

### Rage Creep & Round Worm Room Fix

One room in the Womb / Utero has two Rage Creeps and four Round Worms in the center. In Afterbirth, the top Rage Creep will hit the player if they stay at the top door. However, this is not unavoidable damage, as it is possible to kill the top Rage Creep before it fires. Alternatively, it is possible to run to the bottom wall before either Rage Creep begins firing. However, the pot in the center of the room messes with the AI of the Round Worms, so the pot has been removed to make traversing this room slightly more consistent.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Womb: #202
* Utero: #202

<br />

### Leaper & Pokey Room Fix

On the room with the two Leapers and two Pokeys, certain attack patterns can lead to unavoidable damage. The room has been made slightly more spacious to account for this.

The changed room is as follows:
* Depths: #110

<br />

### Pooter Fix

On certain rooms in the Basement/Cellar, some Pooters can fly over rocks, causing a pseudo-softlock.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Basement: #135, #391

<br />

### Bomb Puzzle Room Fix

On the bomb puzzle room with four entrances, the random bomb drops were replaced with a set bomb drop to prevent troll bombs from spawning. Also, a rock was also removed to prevent a softlock if the player enters from the left side.

The changed room is as follows:
* Depths: #41
* Necropolis: #41

<br />

### Red Fire Puzzle Room Removal

The puzzle rooms with the red fires along the sides of the room have no consistent strategy with which to avoid the random shots.

The removed room is as follows:
* Basement: #771
* Cellar: #771

<br />

### Forsaken Fix

If a Forsaken does a Brimstone attack in the middle of a L-shaped room, it can sometimes be unavoidable. To fix this, Forsakens were replaced with alternate bosses.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Chest: #295, #296

<br />

### No Doors Fix

One room in the game does not have any doors, which is obviously a mistake.

The changed room is as follows:
* Caves: #208

<br />

### Nerve Ending Fix

Some rooms in the game have Nerve Endings next to doors. These are unavoidable damage if the Nerve Endings happen to spawn as their champion variant. This bug is fixed by removing or moving some Nerve Endings.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Womb: #147, #825
* Utero: #147, #825

<br />

### Pale Fatty Fix

In some rooms, Edmund placed a rediculous amount of Pale Fatties. The number has been reduced to 8, which is possible to consistently kill without getting hit on a basic build.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Caves: #843, #854
* Catacombs: #843, #854

<br />

### Fire Fix

In one room, fires spawn close to the entrance. If the fire becomes a champion red fire, then the player can take unavoidable damage. This bug has been fixed by replacing the Fire with Fire Places, which are guaranteed to not spawn as red fires.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Depths: #863
* Necropolis: #863

<br />

### Hive Fix

In one room, the Drowned Chargers that spawn from a Hive can be unavoidable damage. The Hives have been slightly moved to accommodate for this.

The changed room is as follows:
* Caves: #519

<br />

### Boil Softlock Fix

In one room, there are Boils behind a Key Block, which can lead to a softlock if you have no keys or bombs. The stacked Boils have been removed.

The changed room is as follows:
* Womb: #692
* Utero: #692

<br />

### Double Trouble Softlock Fix

On this room, it is impossible to get to the next floor if the player is out of bombs. Some rocks have been removed to fix this.

The changed room is as follows:
* Double Trouble: #3732

<br />

### I AM ERROR Door/Entrance Fixes

On several I AM ERROR rooms, objects overlap with the doors, which can cause unavoidable damage in certain situations.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* 
* #14 (deleted poops)
* #15 (added doors) 
* #26 (moved pickups)

<br />

### Door Fixes

On certain rooms, doors were poorly placed so that they overlap with entities or objects. And in some rooms, doors are disabled for no reason.

The changed rooms are as follows:

* Chest: #39 (double Mega Maw)
* I AM ERROR: #1, #5, #9, #11, #17, #21, #23, #24, #27 (removed doors)
* Boss: #1125 (Larry Jr.)

<br />

## Room Changes - Miscellaneous

### Graphics

Props were removed from the starting room for better visibility.

<br />

### Donation Machine Room Removal

One room in the Necropolis has a donation machine in it. Since using a mod (or the BLCK CNDL seed) removes donation machines from the game, this room is largely useless.

The removed room is as follows:
* Necropolis: #469

<br />

### Empty Room Removal

A small number of rooms in the game do not have anything in them. Some other rooms do not have anything in them except for a few rocks.

The removed rooms are as follows:
* Basement: #39, #315
* Cellar: #39
* Caves: #170
* Depths: #378, #428
* Sheol: #73, #89, #255
* Cathedral: #57, #73, #89
* Chest: #42

One room on the Basement/Cellar has the chance to be empty because of stacked entities.

The changed rooms are as follows:
* Basement: #875
* Cellar: #875

<br />

### Out of Bounds Fix

Rooms with entities out of bounds have been placed in bounds. This does not affect gameplay in any way.
* Caves: #203, #363, #406, #427, #428, #429
* Catacombs: #363, #406, #427, #428, #429
* Depths: #430, #455, #457, #460, #463, #471, #472
* Necropolis: #430, #455

<br />

### Symmetry Fix

Certain rooms in the game were probably meant to be symmetrical, but one entity or tile was incorrectly placed. This is fixed.
* Basement: #581, #772
* Cellar: #772
* Caves: #28, #120, #416, #541
* Womb: #705, #757
* Utero: #705, #757
* Cathedral: #23, #41
* Monstro II: #1051
* The Gate: #5042
* Double Trouble: #3800
* Headless Horseman: #4050

<br />





## Rooms That Were Deliberately Not Changed

* Basement #274 - This is a 1x1 room with a TNT barrel to the left/right of the top/bottom entrances. However, on a knife build, if you are playing correctly, you should be pointing it towards the center of the room upon entering.
* Basement/Cellar #401 - This is a 2x1 room with 4 Pooters. If there is a tinted rock in the room, you should ignore it and hustle to kill the Pooters before they get into a softlock position.
* Basement/Cellar #603 - This is a narrow room with 2 Mullibooms. On base speed, you have enough room to dodge them if you avoid the cobwebs.
* Basement/Cellar #752 - This is a narrow room with 3 Mega Troll Bombs. This room is not unavoidable with deterministic fuse timers.
* Basement/Cellar #767 - This is a room with 2 Mega Troll Bombs. This room is not unavoidable with deterministic fuse timers.
* Cellar #766 - This is a 1x1 room with 3 mega troll bombs, but if you stand completely still, they will not damage you.
* Caves #161, #271, #553 - If the enemy by the top door is a explosive champion, the player will not be hit. If the enemy by the top door is a tear champion, the player has a full second to react upon entering.
* Caves #692 - This is a narrow 1x1 room filled with poops. With Ipecac, you can safely shoot left from the top right-hand corner. With Dr. Fetus, you can walk diagonally through the poops to plant your first bomb. With Dr. Fetus and Bomber Boy, it is unavoidable damage.
* Caves/Catacombs #690 - This is a narrow room with 9 Troll Bombs. This room is not unavoidable with deterministic fuse timers.
* Caves/Catacombs #862 - This is a room with 5 Crazy Long Legs. On a low damage build, it is possible for the spiders to come at you from every angle and cause unavoidable damage. However, spider movement is RNG dependant and actual unavoidable damage is rare.
* Caves/Catacombs #885 - This is a narrow room with 4 Blue Gapers. You have enough room to consistently dodge the Gapers.
* Catacombs #267 - This is a room with a Night Crawler right next to the bottom entrance. Night Crawler's cannot spawn as champions, so it will never explode in your face from blue flies.
* Depths/Necropolis #699 - This is a room with 2 Mega Troll Bombs and 4 Troll Bombs. This room is not unavoidable with deterministic fuse timers.
* Sheol #285 - This is a narrow room with 3 Mega Troll Bombs and 1 Troll Bomb. You can simply leave this room, as there are no enemies that cause the doors to become closed.
* Dark Room #287 - This is a room with 3 mega troll bombs and an Imp. If you stand completely still, the troll bombs will not damage you.
* Chest #39 - This is a room with 2 Mega Maws. Even with the champion version, there is enough time to react to the patterns.
* Mama Gurdy - You have enough time to dodge the spikes before the hitbox appears.
* Daddy Long Legs - The multiple stomp attack no longer damages you before the animation begins (like it did in Rebirth).
* Pride (narrow room) - Sometimes, the bombs spawn in such a way that it is unavoidable damage, but this is rare.
